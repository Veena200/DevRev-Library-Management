Simple library management page using HTML, CSS, JavaScript
<br>
<br>
<br>


# Problem Statement
 <br /> 
Build a simple library management page where <br>
  ● Users should be able to see the list of books <br>
  ● Instead of loading all the results on the page, perform paging on the list of books – either implement 10 results per page or load on scroll will be a bonus
 <br>  ● Users should be able to filter the list of books based on Title, Author, Subject and Publish - date
<br>   ● User should be able to see the count of books in based on each criteria [Title, Author, Subject and publish-date]
 <br>
 <br>
